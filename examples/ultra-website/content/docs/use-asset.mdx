# useAsset

When you [build an Ultra project for deployment](/docs/build), static assets in your project will be renamed to include
a <span title="a unique hash based on the content of the asset">content hash</span> in the filename and will be added to the
[asset-manifest.json](/docs/knowledge-base#asset-manifest) in the build output directory.

This means if you were to reference a static asset like below, the browser will receive a `404 Not Found` error when
a request is made for that asset.

```jsx
// A request for the "/cool-cat.png" asset will fail with a 404 :(
export function WhatACoolCatComponent() {
    return (
        <img src="/cool-cat.png" alt="Just a cool cat" />
    )
}
```

This is exactly why the `useAsset` hook exists. It will resolve the new filename of the original asset in the `asset-manifest.json` and return it.

<HotTip>When you're referencing a static asset, wrap it with `useAsset`</HotTip>

#### [Examples](#examples)

```tsx
import useAsset from 'ultra/hooks/use-asset.js'

export function App() {
    // You can assign the returned path to a variable
    // Or you can use it directly in your JSX, as long as it follows the rules of hooks
    const coolCatImage = useAsset('/cool-cat.png')
    return (
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>Cool Cat App</title>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href={useAsset('/styles.css')} />
            </head>
            <body>
                Damn cool Cat App
                <img src={coolCatImage} alt="Just a cool cat" />
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}
```
