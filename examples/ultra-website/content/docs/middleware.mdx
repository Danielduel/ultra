# Middleware

Since **Ultra** uses Hono under-the-covers, it includes middleware support. Here is an example snippet added to `server.tsx` that will add a 'Server' header to every response:
```js
server.use('*', async (c, next) => {
  c.res.headers.set("Server", "Ultra Hono");
  await next();
});
```
If you look in the Dev Tools Network tab and click on localhost, you'll see this line in the Headers tab added to the Response Headers section:
```
server: Ultra Hono
```
See the [Hono middleware docs](https://honojs.dev/docs/api/middleware/) for more details.
