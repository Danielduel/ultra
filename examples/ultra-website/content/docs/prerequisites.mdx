# Prerequisites

These prerequisites are what we recommend to have knowledge and a basic understanding of before you begin your Ultra journey.

#### [Deno](#deno)

Ultra is built to run on the [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime (no NodeJS to be found here). So it's a good idea to familiarize yourself
with the Deno runtime and what makes it tick.
