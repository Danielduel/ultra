# Building for Deployment

To run **Ultra** in production, we recommened using `ultra/build.ts`. It will do the following:

- Create a `.ultra` dir inside of your project
- Transpile your TypeScript and JSX to vanilla JS.
- Vendor all of your dependencies
- Version your source and public files
- Auto generate 2 (two) production import maps (One for client/hydration, and the other for server)

---

A basic `build.ts`

```js
import { createBuilder } from "ultra/build.ts";

// Pass in your entry points here
const builder = createBuilder({
  browserEntrypoint: import.meta.resolve("./client.tsx"),
  serverEntrypoint: import.meta.resolve("./server.tsx"),
});

// You can use globs to ignore certain files from the build pipeline
builder.ignore([
  "./README.md",
  "./importMap.json",
  "./*.dev.json",
  "./*.test.ts",
]);

// This will return an array of build asset, if you wanted to use
// them for any reason...
const result = await builder.build();
```

Run this with `deno run -A ./build.ts`

#### [Running production](#running-production)

You can `cd` into `.ultra` and run `deno task start` to see the production server running.

Production builds run with `--no-remote` ðŸ”¥
