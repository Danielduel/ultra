# Building for Deployment

To run **Ultra** in production, we recommened using `ultra/build.ts`. It will do the following:

- Create a `.ultra` dir inside of your project
- Transpile your TypeScript and JSX to vanilla JS.
- Vendor all of your dependencies
- Version your source and public files
- Auto generate 2 (two) production import maps (One for client/hydration, and the other for server)

<small>There are many existing build files in our [example repos](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples).</small>

#### [Running production](#running-production)

You can `cd` into `.ultra` and run `deno task start` to see the production server running.

Production builds run with `--no-remote` ðŸ”¥
