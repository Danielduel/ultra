# Code Splitting

Writing and shipping native ESM allows you to take advantage of some pretty neat optimisation features. Dynamic imports and the `lazy` API can be used to import components on the fly, in a way that is compatible with `Suspense`.

[React Lazy Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy)

```js
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const OtherComponent = lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent.jsx'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <OtherComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When both server and client rendering this component, the `OtherComponent.jsx` will only be imported when requested. Native code-splitting? YES!
