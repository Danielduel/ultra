# ðŸ“– Philosophy

**Ultra** takes a non-prescriptive approach to web-app development. You can configure it to use most existing libraries that you are accustomed to â€” or you can write your own... 

We want **Ultra** to do a few things, and do them well.

- React Streaming SSR, with Suspense support
- Native import maps from top to bottom
- Import maps with vendored dependencies in production
- Shipping pure, unbundled ESM always
- Simplifying your tool chain, removing the 'black-box bundler' approach
- Write apps that work the same way in the browser that they do on the server
- Utilise service workers to cache your ESM source code
